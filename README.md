Proud of what I accomplished in one week.
Things that helped me.  Listed in priority:
Drawing out the sections for HTML/Bootstrap (need a plan)
Wrote HTML first
Left most styling to CSS
Breaking down JavaScript into individual functions
Stayed with one function until I got it working and then moved on
Created CSS last (took the least time)
Issues
Getting Bootstrap to work right
Creating HTML so you can easily identify items in JavaScript
